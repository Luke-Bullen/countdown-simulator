<%# Future improvements %>

<%# 1) Add a 'Vowel' and 'Consentant' button so that the @letters array is filled by user choice %>
<%# Done by using JavaScript %>

<%# 2) Have a countdown timer on the page - limit on time to give an answer %>
<%# Scale the points given based on the time taken - Quicker answer = more points %>

<%# 3) Give the longest possible word that could have been created %>
<%# More points depending on the ratio of User's input lenght to the longest word length %>

<%# 4) Score keeping for the users session %>

<%# 5) Different weights for letters - eg: 'X' and 'Z' don't appear as often as 'M' %>
